# Grateful Git

## Congrats, you are awesome !

Ever felt like you weren't getting the acknowledgment you deserve as a developer ?

Say no more. Let me introduce you to **Grateful Git**. With this command line utility, your pushes will never be unnoticed.

It has everything you love about git. Every git command can be run using the *gg* command.
 
``` javascript
gg command // gg push, gg pull, gg checkout ...
```
 When a `gg push` command succeeds, you will get congratulations, and you will be cheered by an enthusiastic crowd, like you truly deserve. (Sound currently working on windows only).
 
 ## Installation
 
 Install the package globally using npm. Make sure your npm global folder is in your system PATH.
 
``` javascript
npm install -g grateful-git
```
 The `gg` command shoul now be available.
 
 ## Roadmap
 
 * Make the sound player work on windows
 * Add more behaviors depending on the command / result.
 * Make the player library available as a standalone package.
